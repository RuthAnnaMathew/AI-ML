1. The key differences between AI, ML and DL is:
    Artificial Intelligence (AI): when machines are programmed to act and behave like humans like learning,
                                  reasoning, decision making, etc.
    Example: Like Alexa which can respond to voice commands and answers questions.

    Machines Learning (ML): similar to AI where systems learn by analyzing data and improving their knowledge
                            over time.
    Example: Like Tiktok, which uses AI to learn about what kind of videos you enjoy and recommend accordingly.

    Deep Learning (DL): Used in images and speeches to undersrand and process their patterns.
    Exmaple: like face recognition used in phones.

2. 
Supervised learning is by getting the inputs and outputs and learning how they connect together.
Example: mail with their spam and not spam
   
Unsupervised learning is when the computer learns by itself how the data is grouped.
Example: spotify recommended songs 

3. 
Model: Models are what are used to train by giving data
Training: Giving the model examples to learn from so it can improve
Features: The data you give into the model
Labels: The output the model should learn

4. 
When the model has learned too much from the data it was given and doesnt perform well on new data.
You can avoid this by providing new data and using cross validation.

5. Siri and ALexa that repsonds to voice commands and Spotify which recommends according to your perferences.
